          <p>Similar to revelations or realizations that one has after the subconscious has been mulling over something, or seen something before you have, my works appear in a percolating manner, gently bubbling to the surface from glimpses caught here and there in iterations of drawn lines. I remind myself to sketch slowly, and optimistically, to allow time and space for my imagination to catch on to any imagery appearing before me. And so my work is a reflection of my imagination, and often portrays some wit and humor within an emotional moment, some levity, some abstract feeling personified in a visual manner.</p>
<p>Working with metal lines allows me to transfer that pencil and paper sketch into a tangible object on the wall. I reference my sketch during the welding process, but I welcome the novel variances in character that appear in the metal — sometimes better than the drawing, sometimes not. The final metal form of the work introduces a dichotomy in character — rather than the heaviness or rigidity often associated with metal, the sculpture seems to float on the wall, with curves, motion, fluid feeling, light and shadow, all retaining the ephemeral character of the original found image.</p>      </div>

          <p>I grew up on the eastern shore of Maryland, in Salisbury, with 3 brothers. At a young age I was inspired by my grandfather, whom I met through stories. He was a blacksmith before a professor, and I often tinkered with nuts and bolts to make metal sculptures, telling myself I would learn how to weld them when I was older. I took a high school welding class briefly, but for many years I left behind the notion for other pursuits. Finally, after college, finding myself without a specific intention for my biology degree, I returned to this childhood idea of learning to weld. As it would happen, a welding class through a nearby community college was just about to start. I took it, and went on to work for the instructor as a production welder for nearly two years. As a step to push myself back into art, and having no formal art education, I thought it best to take an introductory sculpture class at the local university. This, in combination with a night course teaching metal fabrication.</p>
<p>Through many hours of learning and drawing and ideating, I made the leap to begin my venture as a working artist. I am currently living in Austin, Texas, where I am now also teaching elementary art. I am incredibly grateful to have wound my way to this point, to be creating in this way, and continuing to further my art.</p>      </div>
